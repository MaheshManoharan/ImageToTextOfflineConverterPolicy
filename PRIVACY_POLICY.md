## Image To Text Offline Converter: Privacy policy ##

Welcome to the Image To Text Offline Converter app for Android!

This app helps to convert or extract text from images, this is available on Google Play developed by Mahesh Manoharan.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (images taken by you from gallery or camera) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,<br />
